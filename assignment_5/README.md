## Assignment 5

Implementation of a farm using OpenMP. Tasks to be computed have to be provided through a for loop with iterations producing one of the input tasks and then awaiting for Ta time (parameter) before executing next iteration. The parallelism degree of the farm should be a parameter. Each task should spent some parametric amount of time (possibly using the active_wait functioN) to produce the final result.
